##### The Meteor Chef
###### \#015 - Getting Started with React

In this recipe, we'll learn how to get started with the React user interface library. We'll refactor Base, the starter kit used here at The Meteor Chef, replacing Blaze with React. We'll learn how to define components, handle routing with Flow Router, and get a feel for React's basic API and how to get data into our applications.
